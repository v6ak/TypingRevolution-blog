title: The Future of Phone and Tablet Keyboards
---
Keyboards have been developed over many years. The development – from typewriters through personal computers to today’s phones and tablets – has been, however, rather conservative. Nobody has succeeded in coming up with something completely different from previous keyboards, because only few users wanted to entirely change their habits. Therefore, if we want to bring about a revolution, we need to be unorthodox in some ways but, *in others, we need to remain conservative*. Now, let us reveal what you can expect from our project.

## Should we modify the keyboard layout?

While many people may find the QWERTY (QWERTZ, AZERTY, …) layout to be inefficient, no attempt to replace it has succeeded so far. We understand what the problem is. Using different layouts on different devices can be rather inconvenient. Using QWERTY on my phone and QWERTZ on my laptop was driving me crazy. Trying to switch to a completely different layout like Dvorak Simplified Keyboard would be even more of a hassle. It gets even worse with traditional physical keyboards, because it is difficult to reorganize the labels, as it’s hard to learn a new keyboard layout without correct key labelling.

There have, however, been some conservative attempts to change keyboard layout. Traditional typewriter keyboards have [a staggered layout for a reason](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40390/why-are-keyboard-keys-staggered/40403#40403). They have been created that way neither for convenience nor for accuracy. It was simply difficult to construct an typewriter with a non-staggered layout. Nowadays, typewriters are gone, but most computer keyboards still have the staggered layout, although that is not always true for mobile phones and tablets. For example, on the iPhone QWERTY keyboard, you can find “Z” exactly under “S”. On a typical staggered QWERTY keyboard, “Z” is under “A” and “S”. Blackberry phones also have a columnar (non-staggered) keyboard layout.

Why do all these devices differ so much in staggering? Well, staggering is closely connected with the way you hold your device. Since people hold various devices (e.g. tablet, phone and notebook) differently, they have different needs and to various extent transfer their typing habits to the way they work with various devices. We intend to revise the staggering, because columnar layout seems to be more appropriate for the keyboard we are developing than the staggered one.


**Verdict:** We will provide the QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, ĄŽERTY, ŪGJRMV and other traditional national layouts for our customers, possibly in a columnar (non-staggered) version. It is worth noting that maintaining many different layouts does not require any hardware modification. Despite the fact that what we are developing is a hardware keyboard, it will be possible to **add a new layout just in a software update**. That may be also good for users of less common layouts, such as Dvorak. We hope we can satisfy even the users of minority layouts.

## Software aid for typing

Software can help with typing in many ways. It can offer suggestions – from mild suggestions to T9 and Swype technologies. It may also help with typing national characters like “ö”, “é”, “ß” and so on. For the Chinese, software is quite essential for typing, as the keyboard simply can’t have all the characters that are used in Chinese. Japanese is even more complex, as it uses two different alphabets besides the Japanese characters.

You can expect suggestions (optional) for many languages (including many minor languages) and specific support for several languages like Chinese and Japanese.

This is where our new project comes into play. It will be a **synergy of both software and hardware and will make your typing experience more natural**. As a result, even less experienced typists should get accustomed to the keyboard quickly.

## Readjust the way we hold the keyboard

Typewriters usually sit on a desk and their keyboards have been designed with that in mind. That is, you can type with all ten fingers. You may have tried the same with your tablet. However, besides the fact that it is not always possible, it is not practical with 7" tablets. They are too small, even in the landscape mode. This, however, can be changed by readjusting the way we hold the phone or tablet. Stay tuned for more information…

## In a nutshell…

* We’ll preserve the QWERTY (or AZERTY or so) traditional layout. (Dvorak and similar layouts might be optional.)
* Changing the layout will be possible just by a software update.
* We’ll revise the staggering in order to make it more comfortable.
* **We’ll provide a completely new way for you to use the keyboard (stay tuned…)**
* **We’ll provide a special software aid that combines the best from both software and hardware keyboards (stay tuned…)**
* Be ready to hear more in a few weeks.
